# Section 1: Overview

Section 1 introduces you to R Basics, Functions and Datatypes.

In Section 1, you will learn to:

* Appreciate the rationale for data analysis using R
* Define objects and perform basic arithmetic and logical operations
* Use pre-defined functions to perform operations on objects
* Distinguish between various data types


## 1.1 Motivation

Building blocks to learn R in the course.

## Base R

## 1.2 R Basics

### Objects
define a variable 

a <- 1
b <- 1
c <- -1

to view object values we can print them using:

_print(object)_

to see all variables in workspace use:

_ls()_
